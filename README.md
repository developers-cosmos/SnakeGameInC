# 2d Snake game in C using OpenGL

About OpenGL:
Open Graphics Library (OpenGL) is a cross-language (language inependent), cross-platform (platform independent) API for rendering 2D and 3D Vector Graphics(use of polygons to represent image).
Design : This API is defined as a set of functions which may be called by the client program. Although functions are similar to those of C language but it is language independent.
Development : It is an evolving API and Khronos Group regularly releases its new version having some extended feature compare to previous one. GPU vendors may also provide some additional functionality in the form of extension.
Associated Libraries : The earliest version is released with a companion library called OpenGL utility library. But since OpenGL is quite a complex process. So in order to make it easier other library such as OpenGL Utility Toolkit is added which is later superseded by freeglut. Later included library were GLEE, GLEW and glbinding.
